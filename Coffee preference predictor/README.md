This repository contains neural network models developed by me. I make use of pytorch in all files (I might possibly use tensorflow in the future). 
As of 27/05/2025, my latest model using pytorch gives the least log loss (binary cross-entropy) of 0.3664, with an average log loss of 0.4100. My other, manually created model gives the least log loss of 0.5441 and an average log loss of 0.5640. These will continue to improve over time.
Presently, the repo contains only binary classification models, which will also be diversified in the future.
